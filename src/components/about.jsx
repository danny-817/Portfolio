        Hi, I'm Dan, thanks for taking a look at my portfolio <br></br>
        <br></br>I'm a junior full stack developer, having completed an
        intensive full-time 13 week coding bootcamp, now looking to start a
        productive and exciting career in tech. I've been trying to change 
        careers for few years which is what prompted me to study for a 
        degree in engineering however I discovered coding and decided I 
        really enjoyed it so this is now me career focus.
